# Claude Integration Fix - Summary

## Problem Analysis

The chat functionality was not working because:

1. **Mixed AI Model Configuration**: The project was partially migrated to use ChatGPT (GPT-4o) but the main builder agent was still configured for Claude 3.7 Sonnet
2. **Missing API Key Configuration**: The Anthropic models were not explicitly configured with the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable
3. **System Message Mismatch**: The system message referenced "GPT-5" while the actual model was different

## Changes Made

### 1. Reverted to Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Stable Version)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/ai-models.ts` - Updated to use Claude 3.5 Sonnet with explicit API key
- `src/mastra/agents/builder.ts` - Updated builder agent to use Claude 3.5 Sonnet with API key
- `src/lib/system.ts` - Updated system message to reference "Claude" instead of "GPT-5"

### 2. Fixed API Key Configuration

**Before:**
```javascript
export const ANTHROPIC_MODEL = anthropic("claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219");
```

**After:**
```javascript
export const ANTHROPIC_MODEL = anthropic("claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", {
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
});
```

### 3. Consistent Model Configuration

Both the AI models file and the builder agent now use the same Claude model with proper API key configuration.

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure your `.env.local` file contains:

```env
# Anthropic Claude API Configuration
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here

# Redis Configuration (for streaming)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Freestyle Configuration
FREESTYLE_API_KEY=your_freestyle_api_key

# Stack Auth Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PROJECT_ID=your_stack_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY=your_stack_client_key
STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY=your_stack_server_key
```

## Verification

✅ **Claude Configuration Tested**: Verified that Claude 3.5 Sonnet responds correctly with the current setup
✅ **API Key Integration**: Confirmed that the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable is properly used
✅ **No Linting Errors**: All modified files pass linting checks
✅ **Development Server**: Confirmed the server starts and responds correctly

## What Was NOT Changed

- **Morph Tools**: Still use OpenAI for their functionality (this is intentional and separate from the main chat)
- **Billing/Stripe Integration**: Remains unchanged
- **Database Schema**: No changes to existing data structures

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Chat Interface**: Open the application and try creating a new app to test the chat functionality
2. **Monitor Performance**: The Claude 3.5 Sonnet model should provide reliable and consistent responses
3. **Optional Optimizations**: Consider upgrading to Claude 3.5 Sonnet (new) when available for better performance

## Troubleshooting

If chat still doesn't work:

1. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set and valid
2. **Verify API Key**: Test with: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`
3. **Check Database Connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and `DATABASE_URL` is correct
4. **Check Redis**: Ensure Redis is running for stream management
5. **Review Console Logs**: Check browser dev tools and server logs for any errors

## Model Information

- **Current Model**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022)
- **Provider**: Anthropic
- **Integration**: @ai-sdk/anthropic v2.0.4
- **Agent Framework**: Mastra Core

The chat functionality should now work reliably with Claude's proven performance for code generation and app building tasks.
